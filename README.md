### 1. Running CLI installer
  * **update system and install privacy packages** (one time needed)
  * Update system and install `tor`, `proxychains4` and `wget` privacy packages on **`Debian`** or **`Ubuntu`** based distributions by using `apt` and `su` or `sudo`:
```
pkgs="proxychains4 tor torsocks wget";
groups | grep debian-tor > /dev/null && cfg_user_tor="echo 'Tor for ${USER} is already configured'" || cfg_user_tor="usermod -a -G debian-tor ${USER}";
sudo -v; (test $? != 0) && su_cmd="echo 'Please enter ROOT password'; su - -c" || su_cmd="echo 'Please enter ${USER} sudo password'; sudo sh -c";
eval "${su_cmd} \"apt -y update; apt -y full-upgrade; apt -y install ${pkgs}; ${cfg_user_tor}; exit\""
```
  * **download or update installer**
  * installer is downloaded anonymously and verified if digital fingerprint match
```
mkdir -p ~/dexsetup && cd ~/dexsetup && rm -f installer.sh && proxychains4 wget "https://github.com/nnmfnwl/dexinstaller/raw/refs/heads/dev.2025.10.23/installer.sh" && sha512sum installer.sh | grep a185c0ab62435ade713f04f2f07da16878cf2b447ab90906280920b14bf3bb228f3aa92c09fe96c98de8e30a0d7b597837c2e8d06d6868c7144298a771edb0b0 && (echo "installer fingerprint verification success") || (sha512sum installer.sh; echo "installer fingerprint verification failed"; rm -f installer.sh)
```
  * **run installer in full interactive mode**:
```
cd ~/dexsetup && bash installer.sh
```
  * Alternative installer run in automatization mode with custom parameters
  * Examples of automatization and custom installer usage by arguments could be found in here [Additional resources](#7-additional-resources)

### 2. Remote desktop management with VNC
  * Open secured SSH tunnel between client and server(replace `10.10.10.10X` with real IP address)
```
ssh -L 5923:127.0.0.1:5903 10.10.10.10X -N
```
  * Use Remmina or any other VNC client to connect to server
```
remmina -c vnc://127.0.0.1:5923
```

### 3. Directory structure
  * All downloaded, generated files, and management scripts are stored at `~/dexsetup`
```
tree -d -L 4 ~/dexsetup/ | less
```
  * Blockchains are using default chain data directories like `~/.litecoin`, `~/.blocknet`, `~/.bitcoin` etc...
```
ls -lah ~/.bitcoin ~/.litecoin/ ~/.blocknet
```
  * Proxychains configuration file been updated at `~/.proxychains/proxychains.conf`
```
less ~/.proxychains/proxychains.conf
```

### 4. Start, Attach, Navigate and Detach from installed dexsetup environment by terminal
  * To **start** `main CLI start script` which opens management only by console interface:
```
cd ~/dexsetup/dexsetup/ && ./start.screen.instance_default.cli.sh
```
  * To **start** `main start GUI script` which opens management by console interface and graphical user interface wallets as well:
```
cd ~/dexsetup/dexsetup/ && ./start.screen.instance_default.gui.sh
```
  * To **Attach** to dexsetup management by `GNU Screen terminal multiplexer` console interface
```
screen -x
```
  * To **list and navigate** screen tabs/windows use shortcut `CTRL + a ^ "` (hold `CTRL` and push `a`, release `CTRL` and then push `"`, which is probably activated as `shift+"`)
  * To **detach and keep running** applications inside screen the console multiplexer use keyboard shortcut `CTRL + a ^ d`
  * All screen terminal multiplexer tabs are nicely named with predefined commands, and user just use enter to confirm commands depending on what is needed

### 5. Using Blocknet(BLOCK) with Litecoin(LTC) dexbot trading strategy 1 generated by installer

#### 5.1.1. Start and sync Blocknet and Litecoin DEX wallet profiles
  * Start Blocknet DEX wallet profile, component `block_dex` with already predefined command:
```
./firejail.blocknet.wallet_block_dex.qt.bin.sh
```
  * Start Litecoin DEX wallet profile, component `ltc_dex` with already predefined command:
```
./firejail.litecoin.wallet_ltc_dex.qt.bin.sh
```

#### 5.1.2. Start and sync Blocknet and Litecoin DEX wallet profiles - additional resources
  * Wallet sync status check by GUI or component `_cli` using command:
```
./getblockchaininfo.basics
```
  * Wallet unlock status check by GUI or component `_cli` using command:
```
./getwalletinfo.basic
```
  * Security recommendation is to to encrypt wallet first by GUI or component `_cli` using command:
```
./encrypt
```
  * **Backup wallet on external drive or another machine** by GUI menu or component `_cli` using command:
```
./backup
```
  * To unlock encrypted wallet by GUI menu or component `_cli` using command:
```
./unlock.full
```

#### 5.2.1. Mandatory finalization and tuning BLOCK/LTC strategy 1
  * After successful **strategy** installation, re-installation or update, it **must be finalized manually by text editor to be able to be used**, because it must be always specified trading address per bot strategy.
  * To finalize by installer generated `BLOCK/LTC` default trading `strategy1`, it must edit two files:
```
editor=geany; ${editor} ~/dexsetup/dexbot/git.src/strategy_BLOCK_LTC_strategy1.py & ${editor} ~/dexsetup/dexbot/git.src/strategy_LTC_BLOCK_strategy1.py
```
  * To finalize and make strategy usable, `blocknet01` and `litecoin01` string must be replaced with valid wallet addresses.
```
    "--makeraddress blocknet01"
    "--takeraddress litecoin01"
```

#### 5.2.2. Mandatory finalization and tuning BLOCK/LTC strategy 1 - Additional resources
  * To generate new wallet address by using GUI menu or component `_cli` using command:
```
./getnewaddress.default
```
  * By default all generated strategy could be found at `~/dexsetup/dexbot/git.src/` with prefix `strategy`
```
cd ~/dexsetup/dexbot/git.src/ && ls -la | grep strategy | grep .py
```
  * Every generated strategy is easy readable well documented configuration based on [`DEXBOT template`](https://github.com/nnmfnwl/dexbot/blob/merge.2025.03.26/howto/examples/bot_v2_template.py) generated as mix with specific strategy trading pair configuration [`BLOCK/LTC`](https://github.com/nnmfnwl/dexsetup/blob/merge.2025.02.06/src/cfg.strategy.block.ltc.sh) , [`BTC/LTC`](https://github.com/nnmfnwl/dexsetup/blob/merge.2025.02.06/src/cfg.strategy.btc.ltc.sh) ...
  * Final strategy tuning is easy but most effective way would be to write own `strategy trading pair configuration` for dexsetup which could be easy shared used again and again.

#### 5.3.1. Strategy Start, Strategy Stop and Orders Cleaning
  * **Start** `DEXBOT pricing proxy` component first
```
./run.firejail.proxy.sh
```
  * **Start** `DEXBOT BLOCK LTC trading strategy1` component:
```
./run.firejail.BLOCK.LTC.strategy1.sh 
```
  * **Start** `DEXBOT LTC BLOCK trading strategy1` component:
```
./run.firejail.LTC.BLOCK.strategy1.sh
```
  * **Stop and Clean** `DEXBOT BLOCK LTC trading strategy1` component by `Control + Z` and:
```
./run.firejail.BLOCK.LTC.strategy1.sh  --canceladdress
```
  * **Stop and Clean** `DEXBOT LTC BLOCK trading strategy1` component by `Control + Z` and:
```
./run.firejail.LTC.BLOCK.strategy1.sh  --canceladdress
```
  * **Start** `DEXBOT BLOCK LTC trading strategy1` component `after manually adding or removing funds` from specified address by:
```
./run.firejail.BLOCK.LTC.strategy1.sh  --reset
```
  * **Start** `DEXBOT LTC BLOCK trading strategy1` component `after manually adding or removing funds` from specified address by:
```
./run.firejail.LTC.BLOCK.strategy1.sh  --reset
```

#### 5.3.2. Strategy Start, Strategy Stop and Orders Cleaning - Additional resources
  * Start BlockDX - Decentralized Exchange Graphical User Interface by `blockdx` component:
```
./firejail.blockdx.default.sh
```
